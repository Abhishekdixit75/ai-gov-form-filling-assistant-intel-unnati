# AI-Powered Form Filling Assistant (Intel Unnati)

> **"Bridging the Gap Between Citizens and Government Services"**

## 📖 Introduction
This project is a prototype **AI-Powered Form Filling Assistant** designed participating in the **Intel Unnati Industrial Training Program**. Ideally, it aims to simplify the often complex and daunting process of filling out government applications for Indian citizens.

By leveraging **PaddleOCR** for document digitization and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for intelligent entity extraction, our system transforms physical documents into digital applications in seconds.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Government forms in India suffer from significant friction points:
*   **Language Barriers**: Access is often limited to English or Hindi, excluding millions of vernacular speakers.
*   **Complexity**: Forms are lengthy, repetitive, and prone to manual error.
*   **Manual Entry**: Citizens repeatedly re-enter the same data (Name, Address, DoB) across different departments.

This leads to high rejection rates, frustration, and a digital divide that excludes the very people these services are meant to help.

## 💡 Our Solution
We have built an intelligent pipeline that acts as a "Digital Assistant":
1.  **Multi-Modal Ingestion**: Upload images, PDFs, or even speak to the assistant naturally.
2.  **Intelligent Extraction**: Using OCR and LLMs to "read" documents like Aadhaar, PAN, and Domicile certificates.
3.  **Global Entity Store**: A central memory that learns about the user. Once it knows your "Date of Birth" from your Aadhaar, it never asks for it again.
4.  **Auto-Filling**: Automatically maps your personal data to any new government form schema.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Our system follows a modular "Layered" pipeline approach to ensure scalability and accuracy.

### Extraction Pipeline
The core logic moves raw data through OCR (Layer 3) to Semantic Understanding (Layer 4).

### Global Entity Store & Merging
Data from multiple documents is merged into a single "Source of Truth" with confidence scores.
